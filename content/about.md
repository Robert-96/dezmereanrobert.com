### Who am I?

My name is **Dezmerean Robert**. I am a problem solver at heart and a **software developer** with **6 years of experience**. With a strong background in Python and JavaScript, I specialize in building high-performance, scalable, and secure applications using modern web frameworks such as Flask and FAST API.

I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the software industry and exploring new technologies to solve complex
problems. In my free time, I enjoy **contributing to open-source** projects and **sharing my knowledge** with the developer community.

Over the years I’ve published a few dozen articles, some more noteworthy than others. You can find all my blog post on the [posts](/posts/) section.

### Where can you find my work?

My work is focused on developing tools that help developers and testers be more productive.

Right now I'm working on [AltWalker](/projects/altwalker/). Curious about my projects?
