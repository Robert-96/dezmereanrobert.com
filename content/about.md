I'm a big fan of open source. My work is focused on developing tools that help developers and testers be more productive.

Right now I'm working on [AltWalker](/projects/altwalker/). Curious about my projects?
Check out my [projects](/projects/) page for a full list of all the software I working/worked on.

You can also find my open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/Robert-96).

Over the years I’ve published a few dozen articles, some more noteworthy than others. You can find all my blog post on the [posts](/posts/) section.
