I am a problem solver at heart and a software developer by profession. With a strong background in Python and JavaScript, I specialize in building high-performance, scalable, and secure applications using modern web frameworks such as Flask and Django. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the software industry and exploring new technologies to solve complex
problems. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and sharing my knowledge with the developer community.

Right now I'm working on [AltWalker](/projects/altwalker/). Curious about my projects?
Check out my [projects](/projects/) page for a full list of all the software I working/worked on.

You can also find my open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/Robert-96).

Over the years I’ve published a few dozen articles, some more noteworthy than others. You can find all my blog post on the [posts](/posts/) section.
