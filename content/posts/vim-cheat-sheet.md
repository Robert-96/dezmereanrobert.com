## Configure VIM for shell scripting

* `syntax: on` or `:set syntax=sh` - turns on syntax highlighting.

  > Note: For this feature to work the file you are editing must have a shebang indicating the file is a shell script (e.g. `#!/bin/bash`).

* `:set hlsearch` - turns on the highlight search results.
* `:set tabstop=4` -  the value to 4 (the default is 8).
* `:set autoindent` - causes VIM to indent a new line the same amount as the line just typed.
