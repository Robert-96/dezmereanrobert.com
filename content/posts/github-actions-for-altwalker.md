This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a GitHub workflow to automatically run your AltWalker tests whenever changes are pushed to your repository.

## Create a workflow for your AltWalker tests

1. Create a new file in your project at `.github/workflows/test.yml` and paste in the YAML below.

    ```yml
    name: AltWalker Tests

    on: [push]

    jobs:
      altwalker-tests:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Setup AltWalker
          uses: altwalker/setup-altwalker@v1

        - name: Check the models
          run: altwalker check -m models/default.json "random(vertex_coverage(100))"
          shell: bash

        - name: Verify the code
          run: altwalker verify tests -m models/default.json
          shell: bash

        - name: Run the tests
          run: altwalker online tests -m models/default.json "random(vertex_coverage(100))"
          shell: bash

        - name: Generate a test sequence
          run: altwalker offline -m models/default.json "random(vertex_coverage(100))" -f steps/steps.json
          shell: bash

        - name: Run a pre-generated sequence
          run: altwalker walk tests steps/steps.json
          shell: bash

        - name: Archive log files
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
          if: ${{ always() }}
          with:
            name: logs
            path: '*.log'
    ```

    Note that all AltWalker commands in this YAML file are written for the starting project generated by `altwalker init`. If you are working with a different project structure or configuration, you may need to update the commands accordingly to ensure they work properly.

1. On GitHub, go to your repositoryâ€™s **Settings** tab and find the **Pages** section of the settings.

1. Choose **GitHub Actions** as the **Source** of your site and press **Save**.

1. Commit the new workflow file and push it to GitHub.

These steps will set up the necessary configuration to run your AltWalker tests whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Running tests with .NET

To run tests with .NET, add the following step to your ``.github/workflows/test.yml`` file:

```yml
- name: Set up .NET 2.1
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
  with:
    dotnet-version: '2.1'
```

Then, update all the AltWalker commands to use the .NET executor.

## Options

By default, the `altwalker/setup-altwalker` action installs the latest available versions of AltWalker and GraphWalker. However, you may need to use a different version for your tests. To specify a different version of AltWalker, use the `altwalker-version` input with the desired version number:

```yml
- name: Setup AltWalker
  uses: altwalker/setup-altwalker@v1
  with:
    altwalker-version: 0.3.1
```

Similarly, to specify a different version of GraphWalker, use the `graphwalker-version` input with the desired version number:

```yml
- name: Setup AltWalker
  uses: altwalker/setup-altwalker@v1
  with:
    graphwalker-version: 4.3.2
```

Make sure to choose a version of GraphWalker that is compatible with the version of AltWalker you are using. You can find more information about the supported versions of AltWalker and Graphwalker in the [altwalker/setup-altwalker](https://github.com/altwalker/setup-altwalker) repository documentation.
